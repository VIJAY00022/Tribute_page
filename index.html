                Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity,
                one of the two pillars of modern physics (the other being quantum mechanics).

                He is best known for his mass-energy equivalence formula E=mc^2 (which has been dubbed "the world's
                most famous equation"). Einstein received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his "services to
                Theoretical Physics," in particular, his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect, which
                was pivotal in establishing quantum theory.
